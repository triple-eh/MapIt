MapIt
=========
## About this project
1. Map it is a simple ExpressJS app that allows you to create maps with select locations
2. It was created to put into practice some basic knowledge of working with NodeJS, SQL, and Google Maps API
3. CSS isn't a priority of this project - functionality is
3. Note, I started building this app before I started my formal CS degree - so there's plenty of best-practice refactoring I'm planning to apply going forward.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Set up a PostgreSQL on your machine and create a database to store data for this project.
3. Update the .env file with your correct local information: username, password, and database
4. Install dependencies: `npm i`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
6. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
7. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
- Authentication is not fully implemented yet. To login, follow `/users/:id/login` route, e.g., `/users/1/login`
